## Introducing myself ðŸ‘‹

Hello, I'm Valerie. Currently pursuing a masters'degree in Applied Information and Data Science at Hochschule Luzern (HSLU). My focus is on statistics, machine learning and data visualiization, and I am confident in working with Python, R and SQL as well as Tableau.
Before transitioning into Data Science, I gained valuable experience working in HR and Learning & Development projects, which has given me strong insights into people-centric business challenges. I'm passionate about using data to solve real-world problems and translating complex information into clear, actionable insights. I enjoy collaborating with others and am committed to continuous learning and growth.
